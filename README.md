## Task 1: Check if a Number is Even or Odd
- `Task_1(2).py` prompts the user to enter an integer.
- It determines whether the number is even or odd using an if-else statement.
- Displays the result accordingly.

## Task 2: Sum of Integers from 1 to 50 Using a Loop
- `Task_2(2).py` calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to 50.
- Uses a for loop to iterate through the range.
- Displays the final computed sum.
